  <p>The project was created for an intro to Computer Networking course. The goal of the project was to create a multithreaded server, so that multiple clients could connect to it at the same time, and communicate to each other.

  <br><br>The default port number used was 1025, to create/write to the sockets. You may need to edit the 'port' variables on the P2PServer and P2PClient, or else the program may not work.

  <br><br>To run the server, execute P2PServer after you compile it. Clients can connect by compiling and running P2PClient. Clients can use /quit (to leave the server), /query (to check how many users are connected), and /time (to view the time you joined the server).</p>
