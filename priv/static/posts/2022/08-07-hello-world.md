Yes, how original. A blog post titled Hello World ðŸ˜›

I first published this website back in 2014 with the hope of one day creating a blog. 

Sadly I never got a chance to fully flesh out or build on top of it, until recently!

After a year of learning Elixir, I've finally decided to work on some side projects to expand my knowledge with the language.

One of those includes the full conversion of my website, and adding a blog feature. 

This was a fun process that I hope to share in more detail but the history of the site went from:

Angular 2 Beta 7 -> Angular 5 -> Angular 8 -> Phoenix LiveView 1.6
