I recently got my hands on an M1 Mac and have been enjoying playing with Stable Diffusion for generating AI Art. As the black sheep of my family I was not born with the ability to draw things at all, but now I'm generating Yoshitaka Amano-esque paintings in ~2-3 minutes (depending on my CFG Scale and sequencing steps for prompts)! Yay science!

This was mostly a test blog post to see how fast I can write text and play with this new fancy editor that just came out - it boasts faster performance than ST4 and actually surprised me when opening my website! That being said this isn't a hefty project by any means but I'd be curious to see how fast I could open up my work projects with Zed :thinking-face:

The best part: it supports Elixir syntax out of the box so that's a huge win in my eyes!
